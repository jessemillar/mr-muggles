We're contemplating using a [Photon](https://store.particle.io/?product=particle-photon) microcontroller from Particle for the brain. This could be handy because it's a small chip, has decent documentation, is cheap ($19), and has built-in WiFi connectivity.

To control orientation and acceleration, we need an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The cheapest chip we've found that fits both an accelerometer and a gyroscope in a single chip is the [GY-521 MPU6050](https://www.addicore.com/GY-521-MPU6050-p/170.htm) ($4.79) from Addicore.

If we wanted more control of the copter's orientation, we could spring for a compass chip. Adafruit sells the [FLORA](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2020) ($19.95) crams an accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass in one chip. However, the price is a bit high for our student budget. In the name of saving money, if a compass becomes necessary, we may end up purchasing a separate compass chip such as the [HMC5883L](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1746) ($9.95) and piggy-backing it on the other chips.

Batteries, brushless motors, and propellers are easy to come by and most any would work according to the current specifications. Our thoughts on this may change depending on desired flight time, thrust, speed, etc.
